# Tap_Match_Espcape
A fast-paced, level-based color-matching game where the player taps to change the character’s color while it moves along a set path. The goal is to match the character’s color with obstacles to pass through them successfully. A single mismatch causes the character to burst, restarting the level and challenging the player’s timing and reflexes.
