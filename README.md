# ðŸŸ¡ Tap Match Escape (2D)  
A fast-paced, level-based color-matching game that tests your timing and reflexes!  

ðŸ“– About  
Tap Match Escape is a dynamic 2D color-matching game where the player taps to change the characterâ€™s color as it moves along a fixed path.  
The goal is to match the characterâ€™s color with the obstacles ahead to pass through successfully.  
A single mismatch causes the character to burst, restarting the level and challenging the playerâ€™s precision and reaction speed.
